<h3>REMARKS.</h3>
<br />

<p>Samuel Appleton was born at New Ipswich, N.H., June 22, 1766, and
died, without issue, at his residence in Boston, on Tuesday, July 12,
1853; having just entered on the eighty-eighth year of his age.</p>

<p>In November, 1819, he married Mrs. Mary Gore, who was much younger
than himself. This union has been marked, on his side, by the most
unvarying confidence and sincere affection. He has ever found his own
delight in gratifying each wish of his wife with an almost boundless
indulgence. And she&mdash;the brilliant and happy mistress of his
hospitable mansion&mdash;has been alike admirable, when presiding over its
social circle, or its more public gayeties; and when, in its private
recesses, she has devoted herself to what she has ever felt to be her
highest duty and her chief privilege,&mdash;that of guarding the declining
years of her husband with the most kind and thoughtful care; cheering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his pathway to the tomb by those considerate attentions, which, both
in life and in death, he so gratefully appreciated and acknowledged.</p>

<p>On the last morning of his life, he enjoyed his usual health. During
the day, however, he suffered pain and uneasiness, apparently the
result of indigestion. Mrs. Appleton, therefore, remained constantly
with him, but without feeling any serious apprehensions. He at length
seemed to be entirely relieved by the means used, and said, "I will
now try to go to sleep." In a few moments, Mrs. Appleton was alarmed
by hearing him breathe once or twice much more loudly than usual. She
ran to his bedside, and his favorite female attendant was immediately
summoned. He was still lying in the same attitude of repose. The sleep
that had fallen upon him so gently was the sleep of death!</p>

<p>This event at once called forth a universal and spontaneous expression
of regard for the deceased from the community in which he had so long
lived. It was unrestrained by any differences of political opinion or
of religious sentiment. Thus, in the "Boston Post," the organ of the
Democratic party of Boston, there appeared the following
communication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"<span class="sc">Samuel Appleton</span> is dead! Never has there been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
summoned from among us a purer man or a more public-spirited
citizen. Possessing strong natural sense and the most plain and
unaffected manners, he was truly simple-hearted and
noble-minded. There was nothing about him of ostentation or
pretence. All his <i>acts</i>, during a long life, praise him.
Beginning with humble prospects, by industry and intelligence
he became one of our wealthiest merchants. As a country
schoolmaster, during the winter months, he was once, when a
young man, '<i>put up at auction</i>, to be boarded out in the
family that would consent to take him at the lowest rate.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Latterly, for many years, probably not a day has passed without
the performance of some deed of kindness great or small,&mdash;some
act of public or private munificence; and each evening saw him
sink to rest, happy in the consciousness that he had made
others happy. In a notice of him, as a benefactor of one of our
chief charitable institutions, published not long since, it is
said: 'In advanced age, and unable to walk from his house, he
continues in the highest and best sense to enjoy life. He has,
indeed, no children; but a numerous band of nephews and nieces
look up to him with truly filial regard. Indeed, the community
itself ventures to apply to him <i>their</i> familiar and
affectionate appellation of "Uncle Sam." This name, in the
abstract so dear to every patriot, could not be more worthily
bestowed.'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That life, so honorable and so useful, rendered
sweet by the daily blessings of those whose necessities or
sufferings have been relieved by his bounty, has been fitly
closed by a calm and peaceful death."</p></div>

<p>Obituary notices of a like favorable character, and characteristic
anecdotes, &amp;c., were inserted in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>"Daily Evening Transcript," the
"Boston Courier," and the "Christian Register," and also in various
other journals.</p>

<p>Public funeral services were held at the Stone Chapel, on Friday
afternoon, at four o'clock. The Hon. Thomas H. Perkins, and a few
other surviving contemporaries of the deceased, were present among the
assemblage of relatives and friends by which the church was filled.</p>

<p>He was buried at Mount Auburn, in a lot which he had purchased many
years ago, and on which he had erected a costly monument. Designing to
embellish that field of the dead, he had authorized an artist in a
foreign country to execute this work without regard to expense. When
completed, it was not in accordance with the simple tastes of Mr.
Appleton. He even desired that he might be buried in his tomb, under a
church in Boston, rather than in the beautiful spot which he had thus
selected and adorned. The existing ordinance of the city rendered it
impossible to comply with this suggestion; and indeed it seemed to be,
on other grounds, inexpedient.</p>

<p>At a stated quarterly meeting of the Trustees of the Massachusetts
General Hospital, held on the same day, the following preamble and
votes, as proposed by the Chairman, were unanimously adopted, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"The funeral of the late Hon. Samuel Appleton takes place this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
afternoon; and the bells of the city are now tolling as a
public expression of respect for one of its worthiest sons and
its noblest benefactors, who, at the advanced age of
eighty-seven years, has died universally beloved and regretted.</p>

<p>"Formerly a Trustee of this Institution, and ever cherishing a
lively interest in its welfare, we are happy to acknowledge our
indebtedness to him, alike for his valuable personal services,
and for a large share of that bounty which he has always so
wisely and so liberally bestowed.</p>

<p>"This Board would present to the widow of the deceased, by whose
affectionate attentions and devoted care his life has been for
so many years prolonged and rendered happy, the assurances of
their profound sympathy, now that she has lost a companion and
friend by whom she was most tenderly beloved.</p>

<p>"<i>Voted</i>, That this Board do now adjourn to attend the funeral
of the deceased."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Appleton left a Will and Codicil, of which a few copies are
printed for the use of his executors and legatees.</p>

<p>These documents were opened and read in the presence of the widow and
some of the relatives, on Saturday, July 16; and the following
anecdote was then related by one of the Executors:&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Isaac Appleton Jewett was a favorite nephew of the deceased,
and, as such, had a bequest of $30,000, and was eventually to receive
besides one-tenth part of the residuary property. He died <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>in January
last, leaving as his heir-at-law a half-sister, who, by the terms of
the will, became entitled to these bequests. There was no
blood-relationship between her and the Testator. <i>A comparative
stranger would thus be a larger legatee than any one of his own
kindred.</i> The Executor called Mr. Appleton's attention to this fact.
His reply was: "I am much obliged for the suggestion: it was a proper
one for you to make. I will consider, and let you know my decision
to-morrow." The next day he said: "I have been thinking of what you
mentioned to me; and if, in the other world, there is any knowledge of
what is done in this, I should not like to have my nephew, whom I so
loved and trusted, find that my first act, on learning his death, is
the revocation or curtailment of a bequest made in his favor, and
which, if he had survived me, would have eventually benefited her who
was nearest and dearest to him. <i>The will must stand as it is.</i>" This
confirmation of a private bequest is no less honorable to the memory
of Mr. Appleton, than are those other two provisions of his will by
which he so bountifully remembers the servants of his household, and
appropriates to public uses so large a part of his princely fortune.</p>

<h2>CODICIL.</h2>
<br />

<p>I, SAMUEL APPLETON, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk, and State of
Massachusetts, merchant, having further considered my last Will and
Testament, bearing date the twenty-eighth day of February, in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, do think proper
to make and publish the following as a Codicil thereunto.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Revokes a clause of the Will;</div><br />

<p>I do hereby revoke and cancel that clause in said last Will and
Testament, giving unto my beloved wife "any of the plate and furniture
belonging to me at the time of my decease, at the appraised value
thereof, to the amount of eight thousand dollars;" and in lieu thereof
I do make the following dispositions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">And gives to widow his mansion-house, 37,
Beacon-street,</div><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

<p>I give and devise unto my beloved wife the dwelling-house, with the
stables, lands, and appurtenances thereunto belonging, now occupied by
me, being the dwelling-house numbered thirty-seven in Beacon-street,
Boston, to have and to hold the same to her, her heirs and assigns for
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And all the plate, &amp;c. therein.</div><br />

<p>And I do also give and bequeath unto my beloved wife all the plate,
furniture, pictures, statuary, books, stores, and other household
articles, belonging to me at the time of my decease; and it is my wish
that no inventory be taken of the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legatees may take property at appraisement, &amp;c.</div><br />

<p>And it is also my wish that each and every of the legatees, in said
last Will and Testament named, may, with the advice and consent of my
executors, take, in lieu of the money to which they are entitled by
said last Will and Testament, any of the property, left by me at the
time of my decease, at the appraised value thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bonds of Executors to be only in a penalty
adequate to protect creditors.</div><br />

<p>And I do also direct that the executors of my said last Will and
Testament shall give bonds in such sum only as the Judge of Probate
may consider sufficient for the payment of the amount of my debts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>In witness whereof, I have hereto set my hand and seal, this eighth

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
